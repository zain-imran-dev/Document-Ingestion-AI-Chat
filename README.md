This project consists of two interconnected n8n workflows that create a complete RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pipeline for document analysis and intelligent querying:

Document Ingestion Pipeline - Automated document processing and vector storage
AI Chat Interface - Interactive conversational AI with document retrieval capabilities
